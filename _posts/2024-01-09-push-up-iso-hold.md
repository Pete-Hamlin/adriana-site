HEY everyone,

Here's your first challenge: **THE PUSH-UP ISO HOLD MAX!**

## SET UP
Get into a high plank position. Go through the following checklist to ensure your position is correct:
- Hands are under the shoulder, chest is over the hands
- Tailbone is tucked in, turning on your abs & your glutes
- Your body is forming a long, straight line from head into heels
- Lastly, start pressing the ground away with your hands to engage your shoulders & lats.

## CHALLENGE
Keeping everything engaged, start bending the arms to lower into a push-up & stop halfway *(as shown in the example photo below)*. This is your position to hold for the maximum time you can!
<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row 50% uniform">
        <div class="3u"></div>
        <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/challenge_1_2.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></div>
        <div class="3u$"></div>
	</div>
</div>


What **NOT** to do in this position:

<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row 50% uniform">
        <div class="8u"><ul><li>Drop your chest forward & raise your hips</li></ul></div>
		<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/challenge_1_3.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></div>
        <div class="8u"><ul><li>Drop your hips</li></ul></div>
		<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/challenge_1_4.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

## MODIFIER

<div class="box alt">
	<div class="row 50% uniform">
        <div class="8u">
            <p>If you need to modify the on-toes position, you can do so by resting your knees on the ground <em>(see example photo on the right)</em>. As you do so, ensure you are preserving the straight line in your body by bending knees down & slightly back to meet the floor.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/challenge_1_5.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></div>
        <div class="8u">
            <p>The most common mistake here is shifting the knees forward upon bending, which causes the hips to shoot right up <em>(see example photo to the right)</em>. While this is a modification of the advanced position, the on-knees push-up position should still feel challenging for the core!</p>
        </div>
		<div class="4u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/challenge_1_6.jpg %}" alt="" /></span></div>
	</div>
</div>

Key checks here:
- Tailbone tucked under 
- Abs & glutes squeezed in

## END OF CHALLENGE
The challenge ends when any other part of your body other than your hands and toes *(and knees, if modifying)* touches the ground.

<br />
And there you have it! The challenge is **ON**. Show me what you've got!

Good luck!
