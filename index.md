Hey, welcome!

Iâ€™m Adri, fitness enthusiast and fully-qualified PT. ðŸ˜Š

Quick summary of me: obsessed with movement & trying to pass it on to as many others as possible.

Why? â€˜Cause we derive countless benefits from movement. I have been training myself and others for over a decade and have experienced (as well as witnessed) the extraordinary power of training in oneâ€™s life.

Training has allowed me to not only do other things I loved better, but also discover & appreciate myself and my abilities. However! The journey to that was full of mistakes & obstacles, which taught me the doâ€™s and donâ€™tâ€™s of fitness.

With this knowledge, my mission now is to help others achieve that point of self-fulfilment in their training while avoiding the hardship that can delay their results (like it did for me).

If you have a fitness goal youâ€™ve been dreaming of for a while, just know you donâ€™t have to get there alone - contact me & letâ€™s make it happen together.
