Hey, I’m Adri! If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the past decade of weightlifting and dance, it’s that feeling strong is *really* cool — and I’m here to help you discover that for yourself!

I’ve been moving pretty much my whole life, whether it’s lifting weights or dancing my heart out, and I’ve seen how powerful movement can be. Strength training has not only made me better at everything I love, but it’s also made me feel more confident, capable, and connected to my body. And this is a feeling you deserve too!

As a gym rat and dancer, I can’t stand still haha, so I bring that energy to my training sessions! I believe fitness should be fun, empowering, and tailored to *you*. No matter your goal — whether it’s lifting heavier, moving better, or just feeling better in your own skin — I’m here to guide you every step of the way.

Ready to feel strong and move like never before? Let’s make it happen!
