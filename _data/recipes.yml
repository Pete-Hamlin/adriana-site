    This dish is hands-down one of my top 3 because it saves me when I'm:
    - absolutellyyyy starving;
    - on-the-run;
    - needing to meet macros.

    In just its most basic form, it's got everything you'd need for a well-rounded meal: protein, healthy fats, carbs & heappssss of fibre. You can tweak each macro however you like & be guaranteed an amazing meal in under 15min. 
    
    3 easy cooking steps:
    1. throw veggies in the pan with some oil;
    2. add beaten eggs over veggies & cook until done;
    3. roast tortilla in same pan afterwards.
    
    It's THE PERFECT choice for days when life is just crazy, but you still want to keep fueled & enjoy eating your food.

      - Whatever you like to have in a wrap
      - Any veggies you like as side (raw/pickled/cooked)

    In the example picture, I've got:
    - ham & cheddar wrap
    - ready-cooked chicken & mozzarella
    - raw cherry tomatoes & cucumber
    - canned olives & beetroot
   
    OK hear me out: you MUST own a sandwich toaster. If you don't, time to buy one now 'cause it will change your life.
    
    This dish right here is another absolute favourite of mine. It's the best choice for any meal of the day 'cause it requires no cooking on the stove. 
    
    I call these 'instant wraps' because they are the only dish that can get me from 'OMG I think my stomach may be eating itself' to 'OK belly is full and happy' in less than 10 minutes. Which in making-food-while-friggin'-starving terms is basically instant. Oh, and all while I still get the perfect balance carbs-protein-fats-fibre. Happy days!!ðŸ’…
